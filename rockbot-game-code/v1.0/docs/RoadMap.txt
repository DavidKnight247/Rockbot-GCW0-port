************************************
BUGS
************************************
- when entering the boss room, must interrupt sliding
- charging colors not showing when sliding
- boss is not teleporting-in (not updating screen?)
- colorcycle out of sync sometimes
- chain is bigger when facing direction right
- fix charging while passing through doors (keep charge)
- projectile _target_position must take target width/heigth in account
- fix charged-shop foring position
- add reducer in projectile movement, so it will reflect nearest the shielded target

************************************
NEW FEATURES
************************************
- convert file-format to a new, clean one (get from 2.0)
    * clean, no dependencies of older formats
    * convert automaticaly from old version
    * editable intro
    * flag to indicate wich frame of an attack will fire the projectile
    * suport for armor parts
    * support for in-game store
    * sub-bosses

- four selectable players
    * rockbot and betabot physics must be almost the same
    * kitty is fast and jumps high
    * candy tales only 1 point of damage

- find a way to batch convert colors in all images, so we can fix the OSX version graphics transparency
- OSX port
- PS2: add ISO/CD version
- separate move and draw logic
- get some free sound effects to replace Capcom ones
- metool shooting only when attack animation ends


- logic to allow showing player even if stage/map are NULL
- sub-boss (teleports in, can't leave room if its alive)
- different icons for items depending on player (change colors, etc)
- upgrade armor parts like Megaman-X
	- beta: (double-jump, spike-immunity, double-charge)
	- rock: (airdash, half-damage, hiper-buster)

MEDIUM - add "flashing" effect to be used when shooting dynamite's weapon (similar to mm2 flashman's)
- AI:
	- when walk is blocked, check if hit a full-wall before jumping
- AI ACTIONS:
	- add 4 types of jump in AI - short, medium, long, moonwalk
	- add jump-up (and jump-down together) to AI (parameter for jump up is gravity level)

- all Megaman 1 features:
    - option for automatic respawn after "x" seconds
    - platform becomes intangible after X pixels, for TILESIZE pixels
    - slippery ice terrain

- implement bolts and shop (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=432642990156602&set=a.114335308654040.27951.114325318655039&type=1&relevant_count=1&ref=nf)
- verify possibility of a Dreamcast port: (http://dcemulation.org/?title=CodeBlocks_DC_Dev)
    - load in memory only graphics used in the stage or spawn-npc for NPC and objects
    - load in memory only the tiles used in the stage, not the whole tileset (use C++ std::map)
- MacOSX port (?)

- EDITOR: clean editor code (find slots that aren't used anymore)
LOW - HP bars must not be drawn under 3rd level of tiles
- move all drawing methods such as hp-bar, icons, path, etc to draw class; so graphlib only deals with SDL making easier to change it to other graphical library
OPTIMIZATION:
        - OPTIMIZATION: use coverity
        - OPTIMIZATION: use cppcheck (plugin for qtcreator: http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/26113)
        - Optimize editor: in editor_area, do not alloc pixmaps every time, only when changing beaten flag or stage
        - check for ALL places in game that can use game_data directly instead of creating new instances
                - refactor code, so that "game_npcs" do not replicate(copy) data from game_data
                - refactor code, so npcs and players do not replicate(copy) CONST data from game_data, only DYNAMIC such as position, state and HP
        - use optimization tricks for SDL (http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/rendering/SDL-optimizing.html)
