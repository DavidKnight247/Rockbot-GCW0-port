I am the creator of Rockbot (rockbot.upperland.net) a mega man like game.
I'm in the process of creating a second version for the game and,
this time, I'll pick the enemies, bosses and stages by contest, so I'm inviting you to participate.
So what do I need: drawings of enemies (they all need to be robots) or bosses or stage.
You can send me (protoman@upperland.net) existing or new art.

Here is an example of drawings Capcom used in Megaman 10 bosses:

- história:
Sem notícias de betabot, rock treina candy como companheira enquanto ajuda a polícia.
Um dia, descobre-se que Dr. Destrin fugiu (primeira fase é na prisão, fazer referências
a um sonho de liberdade) e logo novos inimigos aparecem para tentar destruir a cidade
como vingança em nome de Destrin.

- estágios:
	* gelo (desliza, avalanche, etc)
	* storm/rain/lighthing (toad)
	* fire/lava
	* industrial (rocket/missile/sparkman)
	* zoo (animals)
	* russia (cossack)
	* lizzard (like mm3 snakeman)

		=> http://i195.photobucket.com/albums/z196/kenshinmeowth/dragonman_zps24db1c46.png
	* cosmos (signos/saint-seya) [low gravity like mm5 starman]


- flag in map background - do not scroll (when changing maps) -> must be the same bg for all 3 maps, in this case

- new file-format
	* stage EFFECT flag (rain, snow, dark, storming, etc)
	* must work from a new empty database:
		* if projectile does not have graphic, use a 4x3 rectangle
		* only load existing objects and npcs into the list (id != -1)

	* intro
	* "path" platform object
	* add flag(int8) to define witch frame of ANIM_ATTACK will fire the projectile (default if last)
	* sub-boss flag on NPC
	* powerups
		+ new item type (jump, attack, body)
		+ on player, you must define what each powerup will change on it
							JUMP           ATTACK              BODY
							-----------------------------------------------------
			* rockbot:      double         super-shot          half-damage
			* candybot:     triple         laser-beam          2x intangible-time
			* beta/dark:    air-dash       double-charged      no push-back
			* kitty:        grab wall      temp-freeze-enemy   roll-attack


- optimization:
	* use Uint8 when possible
	* use data directly from game_data and stage_data, when possible (is const)
	* have a sub-list of NPCs and Objects that only includes the items on-screen
		- change-scrolling must have a method that will check if cumulative change is >= tilesize
		- if scroll reaches >= tilesize, it will re-create those lists


- two initial characters to select (rock and candy), beating the game opens Beta (dark bot now) and kitty bot
- rock not have the same movement than beta on first game, slower and smaller jump
- candy have the movement of rock in first game

- sub-bosses
	- each map have a sub-boss-killed-flag (boolean), false by default, that is set once the sub-boss is killed
	- the boss_door after it only opens if the sub-boss-killed-flag is active



- special platform type, foolows a line
	- have a tile in line that makes it fall (gutsman)
	- can go left, right, up and down
	- if line ends, return, otherwise loops
	- this should be a kind of special item (not stored with other items to avoid confusion and filesystem issues)
	- editor must show the item (translucent) while you are moving the mouse to place it
	- filesystem:
		- store as path (n tiles, direction)
		- store "fail" points as coordinates

- AI: add parameter to define what is the distance for player-near reaction

- slippery (ice) terrain

SEQUENCE - Ape, Dynamite, Mage, Seahorse, Daisie, Techno, Mummy, Spike (Daisie, Seahorse, Ape x2, Spike)





--------------------------
VERSION 1.0.2
--------------------------
- colorcycle out of sync sometimes
- get some free sound effects to replace Capcom ones


- projectile _target_position must take target width/heigth in account

- chain is bigger when facing direction right
- fix charging while passing through doors (keep charge)

- remove build warnings in PS2, PSP and Dingux
- EDITOR: clean editor code (find slots that aren't used anymore)
LOW - fix PSP build to use qmake
LOW - HP bars must not be drawn under 3rd level of tiles
- move all drawing methods such as hp-bar, icons, path, etc to draw class; so graphlib only deals with SDL making easier to change it to other graphical library
OPTIMIZATION:
	- OPTIMIZATION: use coverity
	- OPTIMIZATION: use cppcheck (plugin for qtcreator: http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/26113)
	- Optimize editor: in editor_area, do not alloc pixmaps every time, only when changing beaten flag or stage
	- check for ALL places in game that can use game_data directly instead of creating new instances
		- refactor code, so that "game_npcs" do not replicate(copy) data from game_data
		- refactor code, so npcs and players do not replicate(copy) CONST data from game_data, only DYNAMIC such as position, state and HP
	- use optimization tricks for SDL (http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/rendering/SDL-optimizing.html)

--------------------------

- verify possibility of a Dreamcast port: (http://dcemulation.org/?title=CodeBlocks_DC_Dev)
    - load in memory only graphics used in the stage or spawn-npc for NPC and objects
    - load in memory only the tiles used in the stage, not the whole tileset (use C++ std::map)
