----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 v 1.0 Completion Requirements:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- feature parity with 0.1 rc1
- store the game into a single file
- game file format must be version numbered (each version will be a .h file)
- editor must convert from lower to higher versions
- editor must show error if game version is higher than itself


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 TODO:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PERMANENT: (those bugs return often, should be fixed when possible, not associated to any release)
- EDITOR: items and NPCs are being duplicated
- crash when pressing ESC on select stage screen
- character::show - error, animation_state value 19 is invalid (related to jump - state.animation_type: 2) (character::show - error, direction value -1 is invalid)


BETA1
- reduce hit push back
- test all stages to assure all can be finished:
	TECHNOBOT - scroll is stopping near the end of stage, review

BETA2:
- stage select cursor isn't blinking
- player can't die on "got weapon" because hit a spike :)
- in some parts/cases, scroll is locking (player need to move left/right so scroll works again)
- after killed, when stage is reset, you can see the animation hit in the place where player will teleport back to the map
- implement platform colision for character going up
- BUG: leaving stairs is buggy
- investigate macOSX port
- common class for stuff like rectangles colision detection
- projectile colision must use the projectile width/heigth (charged shot is missing the target sometimes)
- all character frames must use a single image (better for color changes)
- sound for semi-charged shot
- fill ALL stage and boss dialogs
- implement map checkpoint
- implement items (coil/jet)
- finish editor conversion, disable fields that won't be used in 1.0 version
- implement use weapon tanks

- command line arguments for debug (quick_load and invencible)
- move character, classplayer and classnpc to character folder
- finish the in-game menu
- finish start screen (without 2-player game mode)
- charged shot should count as three/max shots
- editor is multiplying some map-NPCs
- in some cases, jump+left/right near a wall, makes the player pass throught it
- BUG: holding key on initial teleport is crashing game
- BUG: zigzag npcs are not colliding with player
- must not load projectile graphic if there is no need for it
- investigate init_video flags (http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_SetVideoMode)
- use http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_VideoInfo to get the max scale or better resolution to be set
- use optimization tricks for SDL (http://osdl.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/rendering/SDL-optimizing.html)

BETA3:
- diferentiate dash (24 heigth) and slide (16 heigth)
- editor must refresh ALL combos when adding a new item (player, npc, object, stage, map, etc)
- diferences between rockbot and betabot (charged shot, double shot, double jump) [OK on file-format]
- EDITOR: ALL input dialogs must respect the character limits defined in format.h and defines.h
- android port
- ps2 port
- implement key mapping for input
- refactor code, so that "game_npcs" do not replicate(copy) data from game_data
- refactor code, so npcs and players do not replicate(copy) CONST data from game_data, only DYNAMIC such as position, state and HP
- boss intro animation (in editor) [OK on file-format]
- editor: allow multiple types for each image-frame (build a list of each animation type)
- convert boss IA
- convert NPC IA for game_data (chain of smaller parts)
- clean editor code
- check for ALL places in game that can use game_data directly instead of creating new instances


BETA 4:
- implement build project for native Dingoo
- implement build project for PS2
- implement build project for Dreamcast


LATER:
- optimization: use threads for parallel processing of move (player, npcs and projectile) and map rendering (when using 2-speed backgrounds)
- use coverity/cppcheck
- NPC colormap (use same graphic with different colors for different NPCs)
- stage colormap (change some colors in stage, like rockman 6)
- investigate dreamcast port
- investigate xbox port
- investigate macOSX port
- investigate PSP port
