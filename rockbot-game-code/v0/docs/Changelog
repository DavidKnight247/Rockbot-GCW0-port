GAME: wall must scroll lock, only if it is on players moving direction
GAME: make player blink, when intangible

(high)
GAME: player2 is able to leave the screen visible area
GAME: turning of NPC to shoot player is wrong, changing side when not needed
GAME: sometimes, player is hit by a shot above it (problem with scrollY)

(medium)

GAME: add screen to select game
GAME: if the whole screen height have a wall (locked) ahead, do not scroll beyond it, hidding the contents after it (this will allow us to use more regions in the map)
